    <p><b>Think and Grow Rich</b> was written by Napoleon Hill in 1937 and promoted as a personal development
       and self-improvement book. He claimed to be inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and
       later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.
    </p>

    <p>
       <ul>
         <li>The book has sold more than 15 million copies.</li>
         <li>It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill's books.</li>
         <li>BusinessWeek magazine's Best-Seller List ranked it the <b>sixth best-selling</b>  paperback business book 70 years after it was published.</li>
         <li>Think and Grow Rich is listed in John C. Maxwell's A Lifetime "Must Read" Books List.</li>
       </ul>
     </p>

     <p>While the book's title and much of the writing concerns increasing income, the author insists
        that his philosophy can help people succeed in any line of work, to do and be anything they
        can imagine.
    </p>

    <p> <h3>Content</h3>  </p>
    <p>Think and Grow Rich is based on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success, said to be the result
    of more than twenty years of study of many individuals who had amassed personal fortunes.</p>

    <p>Hill studied their habits and drew some 16 "laws" to be applied to achieve success. Think and Grow
      Rich condenses them, providing the reader with 13 principles in the form of a "Philosophy of Achievement".
       The book asserts that desire, faith, and persistence can propel one to great heights if one can suppress
        negative thoughts and focus on long-term goals.
      </p>

<p> <h3>Who is this book for?</h3>
Despite the book’s title, this book is not about how to increase your income and become rich.
 The author’s philosophy can help just about anyone succeed in
 their professional life, achieve their aspirations, and attract success
  in their life, but it’s definitely a must-read for investors and entrepreneurs.
